# **mint.io** *- a digital farmers market* ðŸ¥¬

- mint-io is the final project JoÃ£o Monteiro, Nuno GonÃ§alves and Zach Dive developed for their 3rd and final project in the Ironhack Web-Dev Bootcamp.
- The basic concept behind the web-site is having a platform where farmers can sell directly to consumers. The advantage of mint.io to the normal consumer would be having a cheaper price, home delivered goods, and communicating directly with the provider boosting the local community!
